Neptune Tracker v.0.2 alpha 2

A highly customized Meteor web application for tracking items through a manufacturing process.

Highly experimental and rough all over.

I don't recommend anyone try to run it, nevermind use it.

Although if you can understand my (slightly nuts) river metaphor naming scheme, we can be friends.

Created for Commutron Ind. An Electronics Manufacture in Elbow, Saskatchewan, Canada.
