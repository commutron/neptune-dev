Neptune Tracker v.0.2 (alpha 2)

A highly customized statistical process control application for manufacturing.

Built with React, Meteor, and MongoDB.

Highly experimental and rough all over.

I don't recommend anyone try to run it, nevermind use it.

Although if you can understand my (slightly nuts) river metaphor naming scheme, we can be friends.

Created for Commutron Ind. An Electronics Manufacture in Elbow, Saskatchewan, Canada.
