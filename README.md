Neptune Tracker

A highly customized Meteor web application for tracking items through a maufacturing process.

Highly experimental and rough all over.

I don't recommend anyone try to run it, nevermind use it.

Although if you can understand my (slightly nuts) river metaphor naming scheme, we can be friends.

Created for Commutron Ind. A Electronics Manufacture in Elbow, Saskatchewan, Canada.
